# The-Nucleotide-Mamba

Nucleotide-Mamba is an efficient universal gene classifier based on the Mamba model, and we publish the code for all modules of Nucleotide-Mamba here and all the data we used in our experiments on https://github.com/FanY0906/Data-The-Nucleotide-Mamba. If you want to train Nucleotide-Mamba on your own dataset, or wish to reproduce the results of our experiments, you can refer to the code in Training_and_Test.py.

We have also uploaded models trained on the dataset in The-Nucleotide-Mamba_best_model, if you would like to use these trained models, please refer to recognition.py.
